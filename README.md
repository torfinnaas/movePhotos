# movePhotos

This small project is a personal Python tutorial which also will help to
 move photo-files recursively from the flat-file structure of my local disk to the
 year-month structure of my NAS using the jpeg-files attributes.

##Todo:
- Get directory names from file? or from OS in right local?
- Possible to specify both source and dest. directory?
- Log all move/copy to log-file
